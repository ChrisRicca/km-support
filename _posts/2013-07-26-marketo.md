Marketo keeps their platform closed off, making it difficult to track Marketo form submissions through JavaScript. However, Marketo provides Webhooks, which lets you tell the KISSmetrics tracking servers when something special in Marketo occurs.

If you have forms in Marketo that you wish to track in KISSmetrics, consider the following method.

## Summary

Here is a quick overview of what we'll be doing:

[Step 1][step-1]: Create a field in the Lead Database to save the lead's KISSmetrics anonymous ID.
[Step 2][step-2]: Include the Anonymous ID as a hidden field in your form.
[Step 3][step-3]: Create the webhooks to point to the KISSmetrics tracking servers
[Step 4][step-4]: Include the webhooks as part of the Smart Campaign that triggers upon form submission.
[Step 5][step-5]: When everything is ready, publish the form.
