[Qualaroo][qua] (formerly KISSinsights) is a survey tool that lets you quickly collect feedback directly from you customers, as they are browsing your site. It's great for asking one or two questions while still being unobtrusive.

If the Qualaroo JavaScript and KISSmetrics JavaScript code blocks are both on your page, you'll automatically get these events and properties. There's nothing you need to enable - our scripts handle all the work.
