summary: Get a daily email update of your top metrics with our Daily Metrics Email.
---
If you'd like, we can send you daily updates for up to 9 of your metrics:

* 3 summaries of Revenue, using three different date ranges
- 3 of the metrics Trending Up the most
- 3 of the metrics Trending Down the most

[**Subscribe here**][subscribe]!

This is a fairly new feature and is a bit limited in scope. Particularly, if you have multiple projects/sites/products under your account, the daily email report will be sent for that project/site/product marked as a **"Production" site** with the highest number of incoming events.
