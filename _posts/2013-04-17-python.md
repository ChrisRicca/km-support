Our Python Library has the basic functionality laid out in our [API specifications][specs]. It allows you to record events, set properties and alias users. However, you might miss these features:

* No built-in mechanisms for generating and saving identities for your users
* No built-in mechanisms for automatically tying together *anonymous* and *named* identities. This can still be done manually with the `alias` API call - please refer to [our guide for managing identities][identity].
* No built-in mechanisms for running A/B tests
* No automatic triggering of Events (such as detecting Search Engine traffic)
* Does not support [scheduling sending data via cron][cron]

For these reasons we recommend our JavaScript Library to our users, and to use the Python Library for recording events that occur server-side (account Upgrades may be an example of one such event). You might also consider looking at [other APIs][other] our customers have created.

## Setup

You can download a copy of the API from:

[http://github.com/kissmetrics/KISSmetrics][python]

You will need your API key which you can find in your [site settings][site-settings].

## Usage

First load the KISSmetrics library:

    from KISSmetrics import KM

Before calling any of the common methods you **must** call `KM.init` with a valid API key:

    km = KM(string KM_KEY)

Example:

    km = KM("this is your key")

## Example Calls

    km = KM("this is your key")
    km.identify('bob@bob.com');
    km.record('Viewed Homepage');
    km.record('Signed Up', {'Plan' : 'Pro', 'Amount' : 99.95});
    km.record('Signed Up', {'_d' : 1, '_t' : 1234567890});
    km.set({'gender' : 'male'});
    km.alias('bob', 'bob@bob.com');

## Troubleshooting

If you were watching for the events in [KISSmetrics Live][live] and did not see them, it helps to review what our library logged. The Python library keeps a log file at:

* `/tmp/kissmetrics_error.log`

If you contact support to troubleshoot, please refer to the contents of these files, if possible.
