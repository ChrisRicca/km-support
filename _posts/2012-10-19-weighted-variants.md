By default KISSmetrics tries to distribute your visitors evenly across the different variants you provide. However, there may be instances where you want certain variants seen more than others. For example you might want to test a new design on only a small percentage of users. You can do this by passing in weights for your variants. The following are all valid:

{% highlight js %}
_kmq.push(function(){
  // Even weights, 50% red, 50% green (default)
  KM.ab("Button Color", ["red", "green"])

  // 70% red, 30% green
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":70, "green":30});

  // 70% red, 30% green (using decimals)
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":0.7, "green":0.3});

  // 5:1 red vs. green
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":5, "green":1});


  // KM.ab works with more than just two alternatives
  // 33% red, 33% green, 33% blue
  KM.ab("Button Color", ["red", "green", "blue"])

  // 5:1:1 red vs. green vs. blue
  KM.ab("Button Color", {"red":5, "green":1, "blue":1})
})
{% endhighlight %}
